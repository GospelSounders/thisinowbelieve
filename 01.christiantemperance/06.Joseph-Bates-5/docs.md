# The Story of Captain Joseph Bates - Tobacco

Captain Bates reached his Massachusetts home in February, 1824, and remained with his family and friends several months. During this time a new brig named the Empress, of New Bedford, was launched, rigged, and fitted to his liking, and in August he sailed for Rio Janiero, touching at Richmond, Va., to finish the ship loading. On this passage his experience deepened, and he still advanced in reform. He says:-

***"From the time I resolved to drink no more wine (in 1822), I had occasionally drank beer and cider. But now, [246] on weighing anchor from Hampton Roads, I decided from henceforth to drink no ale, porter, beer, or cider, of any description.*** My prospect for making a profitable and successful voyage was more flattering than my last; for I now owned a part of the Empress and her cargo, and had the confidence of my partners to sell and purchase cargoes as often as it would prove to our advantage, and use my judgment about going to what part of the world I pleased. But with all these many advantages to get rich, I felt sad and homesick. I had provided myself with a number of what I called interesting books, to read in my leisure hours. My wife thought there were more novels and romances than were necessary. In packing my trunk of books, she placed a pocket New Testament, unknown to me, on the top of them. On opening this trunk, I took up the New Testament, and found in the opening pages the following poem by Mrs. Hemans, placed there to arrest my attention:-


```
'Leaves have their time to fall,
And flowers to wither at the north wind's breath,
And stars to set - but all,
Thou has all seasons for thine own, O Death!

'Day is for mortal care,
Eve, for glad meetings round the joyous hearth,
Night, for the dreams of sleep, the voice of prayer,
But all for thee, thou mightiest of the earth.

'Youth and the opening rose
May look like things too glorious for decay,
And smile at thee; but thou art not of those
That wait the ripened bloom to seize their prey.

'We know when moons shall wane,
When summer birds from far shall cross the sea,
When autumn's hue shall tinge the golden grain,
But who shall teach us when to look for thee?

'Is it when spring's first gale
Comes forth to whisper where the violets lie?
Is it when roses in our path grow pale?
They have one season - all are ours to die!

'Thou art where billows foam;
Thou art where music melts upon the air;
Thou art around us in our peaceful home;
And the world calls us forth - and thou art there.'
```

[247] "These lines did arrest my attention. I read them again and again. **My interest in novels and romances ceased from that hour.** Among the many books, I selected Doddridge's 'Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul.' **This and the Bible now interested me more than all other books."**

The Empress arrived at Pernambuco, Brazil, October 30, where her commander was assailed by his associates, as he had been in other places, for refusing to take wine at dinner, as the practice was very common in South America:-

"A large company of us were dining with the American consul, Mr. Bennet. His lady, at the head of the table, filled her glass, and said, 'Captain Bates, shall I have the pleasure of a glass of wine with you?' I responded, and filled my glass with water. Mrs. B. declined, unless I would fill my glass with wine. She was aware, from our previous acquaintance, that I did not drink wine, but she felt disposed to induce me to disregard my former resolutions. As our waiting position attracted the attention of the company,one of them said, 'Why, Mr. Bates, do you refuse to drink Mrs. Bennet's health in a glass of wine?' I replied that I did not drink wine on any occasion, and begged Mrs. B. to accept my offer. She readily condescended, and drank my health in a glass of wine, and I hers in a glass of water.

"The topic of conversation now turned on wine-drinking, and my course in relation to it. **Some concluded that a glass of wine would not injure any one. True, but the person who drank one glass would be likely to drink another, and another, until there was no hope of reform.** Said one, 'I wish I could do as Captain Bates does; I should be much better off.' Another supposed I was a reformed drunkard. **Surely there was no harm in drinking moderately. I endeavored to convince them that the better way to do up the business was not to use it at all.** On another occasion a captain said to me, 'You are like old Mr. _____, of Nantucket; he wouldn't drink sweetened water!'"
