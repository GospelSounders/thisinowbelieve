# The Story of Captain Joseph Bates

Joseph Bates was born ***July 8, 1792***. The following brief account of his parentage and boyhood is taken from his "Autobiography," published in 1868:-

"My honored father and his forefathers were for many years residents in the town of Wareham, Plymouth County, Massachusetts. My mother was the daughter of Mr. Barnabas Nye, of the town of Sandwich, Barnstable County, both towns but a few hours' ride from the noted landing-place of the Pilgrim Fathers.

"My father was a volunteer in the Revolutionary War, and continued in the service of his country during its seven years struggle. When Gen. Lafayette revisited the United States, in 1825, among the many who were pressing to shake hands with him at his reception rooms in the city of Boston was my father. As he approached, the General recognized him, and grasped his hand, saying, 'How do you do, my old friend, Captain
Bates?' 'Do you remember him?' was asked. His answer was something like the following: 'Certainly; he was under my immediate command in the American army.'

"After the war, my father married and settled in Rochester, an adjoining town in Plymouth County, where I was born. In the early part of 1793 we moved to New Bedford, some seven miles distant, where my father entered into commercial business. [240] "During the war with England, in 1812, the town of New Bedford was divided, and the eastern part was called Fairhaven. This was ever afterward my place of residence until I moved with my family to Michigan, in May, 1858.

"In my school-boy days my most ardent desire was to become a sailor. I used to think how gratified I should be if I could only get on board a ship that was going on a voyage of discovery round the world. I wanted to see how it looked on the opposite side. Whenever I thought of asking my father to let me go to sea, my courage failed, for fear he would say, No. When I tried to unburden my mind to my mother, she
endeavored to dissuade me, and proposed some other occupation. At last they permitted me to accompany my uncle on a short trip to Boston, hoping this would cure me; but it had the opposite effect. My parents then complied with my wishes.

"A new ship, called the Fanny, of New Bedford, was about to sail for Europe; the commander, Elias Terry, agreed with my father to take me on the voyage as cabin-boy. In ***June, 1807***, we sailed from New Bedford to take our cargo on board at New York City, for London, England."

With increasing interest ***we follow young Bates in his perilous experience upon the seas, and recognize in him a spirit firm and undaunted, ready to live up to his convictions of right, and we also see the hand of Providence in wonderful deliverances from danger and death.*** At one time he had the courage, under trying circumstances, to ***reject a bribe offered to induce him to take a false oath; and by testifying to the truth he saved the fore-fingers and thumb of his right hand***, with which he wrote during his long life in advocating and defending the noblest reforms of the age. He says:-

"While we were congratulating ourselves respecting our narrow escape from shipwreck, two suspicious looking vessels were endeavoring to cut us off from the shore. Their cannon balls soon began to fall around us, and it [241] became advisable for us to round to and let them come aboard. They proved to be two Danish privateers, who captured us and took us to Copenhagen, where ship and cargo were finally condemned in accordance with Bonaparte's decrees, because of our intercourse with the English.

"In the course of a few weeks we were all called to the court-house to give testimony respecting our voyage. Previously to this, our supercargo, who was also part owner, had promised us a handsome reward if we would testify that our voyage was direct from New York to Copenhagen, and that we had had no intercourse with the English. To this proposition we were not all agreed. We were finally examined separately, my turn coming first. I suppose they first called me into court because I was the only youth among the sailors. One of the three judges asked me in English if I understood the nature of an oath. After I had answered in the affirmative, he bade me look at a box
near by, about fifteen inches long and eight high, and said, 'That box contains a machine to cut off the two forefingers and thumb of every one who swears falsely here. Now,' said he, 'hold up your two forefingers and thumb on your right hand.' In this manner I was sworn to tell the truth, and regardless of any consideration, I testified to the facts concerning our voyage. Afterward, when we were permitted to go aboard, it was clear enough that the 'little box' had brought out the truthful testimony from all; viz., that we had been wrecked by running against an island of ice fourteen days from New York; refitted in Ireland, after which we joined the British convoy, and were captured by the privateers. After this, some of our crew, as they were returning from a walk where they had been viewing the prison, said that some of the prisoners thrust their hands through the grating, to show them that they had lost the two forefingers and thumb of
their right hand. They were a crew of Dutchmen, who were likewise taken, and had sworn falsely."
