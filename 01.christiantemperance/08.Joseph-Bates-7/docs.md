# The Story of Captain Joseph Bates - Ministry

Captain Bates retired from the seas in the month of June, 1828, having acquired more than a competency. **He immediately began to devote his time and means to moral reforms, and labored ardently and successfully in this way for about twelve years, when he became an Adventist.** He soon entered the lecture field, laboring both as a speaker and writer. **In the cause of what he regarded as Bible truth and reform he employed his means and energies during the remainder of his useful life, a period of thirty-two years.** [251] During his long ministry, reaching from the noon of life to old age, he lost none of his ardor in the cause of moral reform. In fact, his belief that the Son of God would soon come, with all the holy angels, to receive his people and take them to a pure heaven, gave double force to the inspired exhortations to purity of life, and the warnings to be ready for the coming of that day. While addressing the people upon the subject of being in readiness to meet the Lord at his coming, we have often heard him apply these texts with great force: "Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares." "What agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean, and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God." "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are." 1(64) When we expect a visit from friends whom we love and honor, how natural to put things in good order, and dress suitably for the occasion! This may well illustrate the action of those Adventists who are really such, in adopting the rules of clean, pure, practical hygiene.
