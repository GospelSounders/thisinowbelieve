# The Story of Captain Joseph Bates - Reform Benefits

At a health reform convention held at Battle Creek, Mich., in the spring of 1871, Elder Bates, in his seventy-ninth year, made a speech of remarkable interest, into which he incorporated some items of his personal history and experience. He closed with the following **summary of the benefits he had derived from adopting the principles of hygienic reform:-**

1. "From the ruinous habits of a common sailor, by the help of the Lord I walked out into the ranks of sober, industrious, discerning men, who were pleased to employ and promote me in my calling, so that in the space of nine years I was supercargo and joint owner in the vessel and cargo which I commanded, with unrestricted commission to go where I thought best, and continue my voyage as long as I should judge best, for our interest. [254] "The morning after my arrival in New York, among the laborers who came on board to discharge my vessel, was a Mr. Davis, one of my most intimate friends during my imprisonment. 1(66) **We had spent many hours together talking over our dismal position, and the dreadful state and ruinous habits of our fellow-prisoners, and there agreed that if ever we were liberated, we would labor to avoid the dreadful habit of intemperance, and seek for a standing among sober, reflecting men.** Now, aside from his associates, we conversed freely, and he readily admitted our feelings and resolutions in the past, but with sadness of heart acknowledged his lack of moral courage to reform; and now, in this uncertain way, he was seeking for daily labor, when his poor state of health would admit of it.

2. "**When I reached this point of total abstinence, God in mercy arrested my attention, and on the free confession of my sins, he, for his dear Son's sake, granted me his rich grace and pardoning mercy.**

3. "Contrary to my former convictions, that if I was ever permitted to live to my present age I should be a suffering cripple, from my early exposure in following the sea, **thanks be to God and our dear Lord and Saviour, whose rich blessing ever follows every personal effort to reform, that I am entirely free from aches and pains, with the gladdening, cheering prospect that if I continue to reform, and forsake every wrong, I shall, with the redeemed followers of the Lamb, stand 'without fault before the throne of God.'"**

No comment on the foregoing is needed. And it is hardly necessary to state that this speech, from one who had reached nearly fourscore years, and who could look back upon a long life of self-control, marked all the way with new victories and new joys, electrified the audience. **He then stood as straight as a monument, and could tread the side-walks as lightly as a fox. He stated that his [255] digestion was perfect, and that he never ate and slept better at any period of his life.**
