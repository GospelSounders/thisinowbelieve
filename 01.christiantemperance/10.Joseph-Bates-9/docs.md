# The Story of Captain Joseph Bates - Flesh Meats

The writer first met Elder Bates at his home at Fairhaven, Mass., **in the year 1846. He had at that time banished flesh-meats of all kinds, grease, butter, and spices, from his own plate.** When asked why he did not use these things, his usual reply was, "I have eaten my share of them." He did not mention his views of proper diet in public at that time, nor in private, unless questioned upon the subject. When I first became acquainted with Elder Bates, he was fifty-four years of age. His countenance was fair, his eye was clear and mild, his figure was erect and of fine proportions, and he was the last man to be picked out of the crowd as one who had endured the hardships and exposure of sea life, and who had come in contact with the demoralizing influences of such a life for more than a score of years. **It had been eighteen years since he left the seas, and during that time his life of rigid temperance in eating, as well as in drinking, and his labors in the pure sphere of moral reform, had regenerated the entire man, body, soul, and spirit, until he seemed almost recreated [253] for the special work to which God had called him.** `"Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord."` Isaiah 52:11.

Elder Bates was a true gentleman. A man of great natural firmness and independence, after twenty-one years of sea-faring life, a large part of the time as
commander of rough sailors - it might be supposed that he would be exacting and overbearing in his efforts to reform others. True, he would speak what he regarded as truth with great freedom and boldness; but after he had set forth principles, and urged the importance of obedience to them, he was willing to leave his hearers free to decide for themselves.
