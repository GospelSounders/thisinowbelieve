# The Story of Captain Joseph Bates - 2 Meals a Day

When many of his fellow-laborers embraced the principles of health reform, and began to advocate them (about the year 1860), he joined them in this work with great gladness of heart that he had sympathizers and fellow-workers in the cause. He now began to speak freely upon the subject, both in public and private. **Up to this time he had refused all fruits and nuts because of the custom of eating them between meals. But when many of his brethren adopted only two meals a day, and furnished their tables with fruits and nuts, he would partake freely of them with his meals.**
