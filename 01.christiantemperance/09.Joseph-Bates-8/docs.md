# The Story of Captain Joseph Bates - Tea and Coffee

Captain Bates began his table reform about the time he left his sea-faring life. He says:-

"From the year 1824, when I made my covenant with God, **I had lived up to the principles of total abstinence from all intoxicating drinks, but had continued the use of tea and coffee, without much conviction as to their poisonous [252] and stimulating effects, for seven years longer.** With my small stock of knowledge on the subject, I was unwilling to believe that these stimulants had any effect on me, until on a social visit with my wife at one of our neighbors', where tea was served us somewhat stronger than it was our usual habit to drink. **It had such an effect on my whole system that I could not rest or sleep until after midnight. I then became fully satisfied - and have never since seen cause to change my belief - that it was the tea I had drank which so affected me. From thence I became convicted of its injurious qualities, and discarded the use of it.**

"**Soon after this, on the same principle, I ceased the use of coffee, so that it is now about thirty years since I have allowed myself knowingly to taste of either.** If the reader should ask how much I have gained in this matter, I answer that **my health is better, my mind is clearer, and my conscience in this respect is void of offense."**
