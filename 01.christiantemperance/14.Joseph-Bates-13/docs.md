# Adventist Church Works to Clarify its Stance on Abortion
## Dialogue includes a diverse group of Adventist theologians, medical professionals and Church leaders

Quoting from the Committee’s Terms of Reference, Stele emphasized that the group’s third responsibility is to “prepare a draft of one unified statement that will clearly be based on **biblical principles that underline the sanctity of life and recognize the exceptionally difficult cases/anomalies** women can face.” 

“This is a deeply sensitive topic,” says Peter Landless, director of Health Ministries for the Seventh-day Adventist Church. **“My prayer is that the outcome of the deliberations will positively benefit and strengthen the work and practice of our mission in all spheres.”**

BRI director Elias Brasil de Souza agrees, saying “my hope is that **this process will help church members and the Adventist community know where the Church stands on such a critical issue. It is important to the process that the results reflect faithfulness to Scripture.”**

“As a health professional who understands how **these statements will impact the lives of real people struggling with difficult decisions**, I am encouraged by the process we are going through,” says Katia Reinert associate director of Health Ministries, and a member of both the Working Group and the Writing Committee. She concludes, “I feel confident that **we will have a statement that will provide biblical and practical insight for future guidelines, *taking into account the need for healing and wholeness of individuals and families living in a broken world.”**
