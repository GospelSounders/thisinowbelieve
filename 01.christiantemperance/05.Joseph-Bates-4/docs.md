# The Story of Captain Joseph Bates - Tobacco

"***I was also making great efforts to conquer another sin, which I had learned of wicked sailors. That was the habit of using profane language***. My father had been a praying man from the time I had any knowledge of him. My mother embraced religion when I was about twelve years old. I never dared, even after my marriage, to speak irreverently of God in the presence of my father. As he had endeavored to train me in the way I should go, I knew the way; but the checkered scenes of my seafaring life had thrown me from the track, which I was trying now to regain."
