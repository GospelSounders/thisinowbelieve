# The Story of Captain Joseph Bates - Ardent Spirits

As ***the primary object of this sketch is to present Elder Bates to the reader as a true reformer***, we pass over the [242] perils and shipwrecks, the captures and imprisonments by sea and on land, the scenes of great suffering and providential escape, during the first eight years of his sailor life, up to the time he rejoined the home circle in ***June, 1815***. Speaking of this time he says:-

"My father had been told by those who thought they knew, that if I ever did return home I would be like other drunken man-o'-war sailors. Our meeting quite overcame him. At length he recovered, and asked me if I had injured my constitution. 'No, father,' I replied, ***'I became disgusted with the `intemperate habits` of the people I was associated with. I have no particular desire for strong drink.'*** This much relieved his mind."

In ***1821*** Joseph Bates became master of a vessel, and sailed on a voyage to South America. Not only did he have charge of the ship, but the cargo also was confided to him for sales and returns. Of his ***convictions on the subject of total abstinence from ardent spirits***, he says:-

"While on our passage home, ***I was convicted of a serious error, in that I had for more than a year allowed myself to drink ardent spirits, although I had before practiced entire abstinence***, having become disgusted with the debasing and demoralizing effects of strong drink, and being well satisfied that drinking men were daily ruining themselves, and moving with rapid strides to the drunkard's grave. Although ***I had taken measures to secure myself from the drunkard's path by not allowing myself in any case whatever to drink more than one glass of ardent spirits per day, which I most strictly adhered to; yet the strong desire for that one glass, when coming to the dinner hour, the usual time for it, was stronger than my appetite for food, and I became alarmed.*** While reflecting about this matter, ***I solemnly resolved that I would never drink another glass of ardent spirits while I lived. It is now about forty-six years since that important era in the history of my life, and I have no knowledge of ever violating that vow, having never since used spirits, except for medicinal purposes.*** This circumstance [243] gave a new spring to my whole being, and made me feel like a free man. ***Still it was considered genteel to drink wine in company."***

The mind of the youthful master was evidently guarded from corrupting influences, and deeply impressed by a high and holy power. The associations in which his position placed him were such as to make it almost impossible for him to keep his solemn pledge, yet he did not waver. ***The true spirit of reform had taken hold of him, and he moved out still further.*** On the passage from Buenos Ayres to Lima, Peru, ***in 1822, he gained another victory, of which he speaks as follows:-***

***"As I had resolved on my previous voyage never more to use ardent spirits except for medicinal purposes, so now I also resolved that I would never drink another glass of wine. In this work of reform I found myself entirely alone, and exposed to the jeering remarks of those with whom I afterward became associated, especially when I declined drinking with them. Yet after all their comments, that it was not improper or dangerous to drink moderately, etc., they were constrained to admit that my course was perfectly safe."***


While in Peru, several months after he had resolved to leave off wine also, our hero was severely tested. His statement, which follows, shows that instead of wavering and yielding to the pressure of associates, he took another firm step in reform:-

"Mr. Swinegar, our Peruvian merchant, gave a large dinner party to the captains and supercargoes of the American vessels, and to a number of the officers of the American squadron, Feb. 22, in honor of General Washington's birthday. As I was the only person at the table who had decided not to drink wine or strong drink because of its intoxicating qualities, Mr. S. stated to some of his friends that he would influence me to drink wine with him. He filled his glass, and challenged me to drink. I responded by filling my glass with water. He refused to drink unless I took the wine. I said, 'Mr. Swinegar, I [244] cannot do so; for I have fully decided never to drink wine.' By this time the company were all looking at us. Mr. S. still waited for me to fill my glass with wine. Several urged me to comply with his request. One of the lieutenants of the squadron, some distance down the table, said, 'Bates, surely you will not object to taking a glass of wine with Mr. Swinegar.' I replied that I could not do it. I felt embarrassed and sorry that a cheerful company should be so intent on my drinking a glass of wine as almost to forget the good dinner that was before them. Mr. S., seeing that I would not be prevailed on to
drink wine, pressed me no further.
