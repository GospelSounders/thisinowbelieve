# The Story of Captain Joseph Bates

>> And Joseph Bates died, and all his brethren, and all that generation... Now there arose up a new breed of adventists, which knew not Joseph Bates, nor recognized his life nor work on Christian Temperance. But ***the primary object of this sketch is to present Elder Bates to the reader as a true reformer...***

The following sketches of the lives of Elder Bates and Elder Andrews were written by Elder James White in 1877, and appeared in the pages of Good Health of that year:-

## ELDER JOSEPH BATES.

SKETCHES of the lives of great and good men are given to the world for the benefit of the generations that follow them. Human life is more or less an experiment to all who enter upon it. Hence the frequent remark that we need to live one life in order to learn how to live. This maxim, in all its unqualified strength of expression, may be a correct statement of the case of the self-confident and incautious; but it need not be wholly true of those who have had good and wise parents, and who have proper respect for the prudent and good people who have made life a success. ***To those who profit by the experiences of those who have fought the good fight, and have finished their course with joy, life is not altogether an experiment.*** Its general outlines, to say the least, may be patterned after those who have, by the grace of God, become good and noble and truly great, in choosing and defending the right.


Reflecting young men and women may acquire, even before they leave parental care, a practical education which will be invaluable to them in future life. This may be done to a considerable extent by careful observation; but in reading the lives of worthy people they may learn lessons by which they will be fortified against the evil, and be enabled to choose the good, that lies all along the path of human life.
Second to our Lord Jesus Christ, Noah, Job, and Daniel are held up before us by the sacred writers as patterns worthy of imitation. The brief sketches of the faith, patience, firmness, and moral excellence of these and [238] other holy men, as found in the pages of sacred history, have been proved to be of inestimable value to all who would walk worthy of the Christian name. They were men subject to like passions as we are. Were some of them, at times, overcome of evil? erring men of our time may bless that record also; for it states how these ancient worthies overcame evil, and fully redeemed their errors, so that, becoming doubly victorious, they shine brightest on the sacred page.

In his epistle to the Hebrews, Paul gives a list of heroes of faith. In chapter eleven he mentions Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob Joseph, Moses, and the prophets, who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, and stopped the mouths of lions. The apostle presents these witnesses as patterns for the Christian church, as may be seen by the use he makes of them in the first verse of the chapter which follows: "Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed about by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us."

***Since the apostle's time, there have been many who exemplified in their life the same firm principles for which the ancient worthies were commended. Elder Joseph Bates was such a man. His life was crowded with unselfish motives and noble actions.*** That which makes his early history intensely interesting to his personal friends, is the fact that ***he became a devoted follower of Christ, a thorough reformer, a Christian gentleman,*** and ripened into a noble manhood, and all this while exposed to the evils of sea-faring life, - from the cabin-boy of 1807 to the wealthy retiring master of 1828, a period of twenty-one years.

Beauty and fragrance are expected of the rose, planted in suitable, well-cultivated soil, and tenderly reared under the watchful eye of the lover of the beautiful; but it is with wonder that we admire the living green, the pure white, and the delicate tints of the water-lily, whose roots reach far down into the cold mire at the bottom of the [239] darksome lake. And we revere the Power that causes this pearl of flowers, uncultivated and obscure, to appropriate to itself all valuable qualities, and to reject the evil.

So, to apply the figure, we reasonably expect excellence of character in those who are guarded against corrupting influences, and whose surroundings are the most favorable to mental and moral development. In our hearts, pressing up to our lips, are blessings for all such. But he who, in the perpetual presence of the uncultivated and vile, and with no visible hand to guard and guide, becomes pure and wise, and devotes his life to the service of God and the good of humanity, - a Christian philanthropist, -such a one is indeed a miracle of God's love and power.

### Notes
Whosoever will may overcome all cultivated and inherited tendencies to evil. None need excuse their defects of character because of their forbiding surroundings. Of Joseph Bates we have read that `he became a devoted follower of Christ, a thorough reformer, a Christian gentleman, and ripened into a noble manhood, and all this while exposed to the evils of sea-faring life`. 

As we come into association with these men, what example will they give us??? 

That ye may be blameless, the sons of God in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation.
