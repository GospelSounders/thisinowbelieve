#### The Subject of Christian Temperance


![Recipes](/sites/christiantemperance/images/heavenly-recipes-1.jpg)


>> ***`And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation... Now there arose up a new king over king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. Exodus 1:6;8`***
 
The principle given in this verse, the spirit that actuated the new Egyptian King, may apply with equal force to the Christian world of today. As the old teachers have one by one passed off the stage of action, there has arisen a new breed of christians indifferent to all that their fathers held dear. That "there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph" does not mean that "he was ignorant of Joseph's services to the nation, but *he wished to make no recognition of them*, and as far as possible, to bury them in oblivion." `PP 241.3` Then the Pharaoh was in a better standing that the average Christian of today who is not only ashamed of the principles held and taught by the pioneers of his faith, but is shamefully ignorant of them. Satanic zeal has been exerted by the leaders of the churches to hide information from even those who would know.
