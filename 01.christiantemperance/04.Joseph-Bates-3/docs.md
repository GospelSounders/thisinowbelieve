# The Story of Captain Joseph Bates - Tobacco

***"At that time my deep convictions with respect to smoking cigars enabled me to decide also that from that evening I would never smoke another cigar, nor smoke tobacco in any way. This victory raised my feelings and elevated my mind above the fog of tobacco-smoke which had to a considerable extent beclouded my mind, and thus I was freed from an idol which I had learned to worship among sailors.***

"I had now been in the Pacific Ocean about fourteen months, and was closing my business and preparing to return to the United States. The ship Candace, Capt. F. Burtody, was about to sail for Boston, Mass., in which ship I engaged my passage. Capt. B. and myself mutually agreed, when the Candace weighed anchor, that ***we would from that hour cease chewing tobacco***. About **the last week of November, 1823**, all hands were called to weigh anchor. None but those who experience these feelings can tell the thrill that fills every soul, from the captain to the cabin-boy, when the order is given to 'weigh anchor for home.' No matter how many seas there are to pass, or how many storms to meet, or how far from home, the joyous feeling still vibrates in every heart, 'Home, home, sweet home! Our anchor's weighed for home!'

"Our good ship now lay by with her main topsail to the mast, until the boat came alongside from the commodore with our specie and silver, which Capt. B. and myself [245] had gained by trading. When this was safe on board, all sail was made on the ship. It was now night, and we were passing our last landmark (St. Lorenzo), and putting out for a long voyage of eight thousand five hundred miles. The steward reported supper ready. **'Here goes my tobacco, Bates,' said Capt. B., taking it from his mouth and casting it overboard. 'And here goes mine, too,' said I, and that was the last that ever polluted my lips.** But Capt. B. failed to overcome, and labored hard to induce me to keep him company. **I was now free from all distilled spirits, wine, and tobacco. Step by step I had gained this victory. Nature never required either, and I never used the articles, except to keep company with my associates.** How many millions have been ruined by such debasing and pernicious habits! How much more like a human being I felt when I had gained the mastery in these things, and overcome them all!
