# The Story of Captain Joseph Bates - Flesh Meats

Elder Bates held a large place in the hearts of his people. Those who knew him longest and best, esteemed him most highly. When his younger and most intimate fellow-laborers told him that his age should excuse him from the fatigue of itinerant life and public speaking, he laid off his armor as a captured officer would surrender his sword on the field of battle. The decision once made, he was as triumphant in faith and hope as before. **Mrs. White wrote to him, recommending a nutritious diet, which called out the following characteristic statements from his pen, written in February, 1872, about forty days before his death:-**

"God bless you, Sister White, for your favor of yesterday, the 13th. You say I must have good, nutritious food. I learn from report that I am starving myself, and am withholding from my daughter, who is with me, and alone a good part of the time in my absence; and that when I ask a blessing at my table, I ask the Lord to bless that which I may eat, and not that which is on the table. This is what I am not guilty of, nor ever was in all my family worship for some fifty years, but once; and I do greatly marvel how my industrious neighbors found out this one exception. But I will tell you the circumstance.

"Several years ago I was with the church in Vassar, Tuscola Co., Mich., and was invited to address them and their children in a barn on the Fourth of July, and also to take dinner with them. The tables were soon up, and loaded with tempting eatables; and I was invited to ask the blessing. **The swine's flesh upon the table I knew was abominable and unclean, and that God had positively, by law, forbidden the eating or touching of it. See Lev.11:7,8 (law, verse 46); also Deut.14:1-3,8. I therefore very quietly distinguished, and asked a blessing on the clean, nutritious, wholesome, lawful food.** Some whispered, and some smiled, others looked, and so on.

[256] "Starving, with more than enough to eat! Now allow me to state what, by the providence and blessing of God, we have in our house from which to choose a daily bill of fare:-

```
"GRAINS.
"90 pounds of superfine white flour.
"100 pounds of graham flour.
"5 bushels of choice garden corn.
"Pop and sweet corn in abundance.
"Cornmeal, rice, and oatmeal.
"Cornstarch, butter, sugar, salt.

"VEGETABLES.
"Three varieties of potatoes.
"Sweet turnips, parsnips, squashes.
"Two varieties of onions.

"FRUITS.
"11 cans of preserved sweet peaches.
"6 cans of sweet grapes.
"Strawberries preserved and dried.
"Quince and grape jelly.
"Tomatoes by the jug.
"20 pounds of dried sweet peaches.
"Box of Isabella grapes, almost consumed.
"Three varieties of apples and quinces.
```

"**But the people say, and think they know what they say, that he refuses to furnish his table with tea and coffee. That's true! They are poison. Some `thirty-five years` ago I was using both tea and coffee. After retiring from a tea-party at midnight, my companion said, 'What is the matter? Can't you lie quiet and sleep?' 'Sleep! no," I said. 'Why not?' was the next question. 'Oh! I wish Mrs. Bunker's tea had been in the East Indies. It's poison.' Here I forever bade adieu to tea and coffee. After awhile my wife joined me, and we banished them from our table and dwelling. That's the reason they are not on my table.**

**"They say, too, that this man does not allow any ardent spirits or strong drink in his house. That's true. Please hear my reason: `Fifty years ago` I was by myself on the boundless ocean. My thoughts troubled me. Said [257] I to Him who always hears, 'I'll never drink another glass of grog or strong drink while I live.' That's why I have no intoxicating drink on or about my premises.**

"**Well, there is another thing that he is fanatical about, and differs from more than half his country-men. What is that? - `He will not have about him nor use any tobacco.` Guilty! My reason: Forty-eight years ago I was away toward the setting sun; our gallant ship was plowing her way through the great Pacific. During the night watch we were called to take some refreshment. I then tossed my chew of tobacco into the ocean, never, no, never, to touch, taste  or handle any more. And allow me to say that when I had gained the victory over this deadening, besotting, benumbing vice, I went on deck the next morning a better man than ever I was in all my former life. Why? - I was free. I could appreciate God's handiwork in sea and sky, even in the tumbling, rolling waves. I could breathe freely, inhaling the pure air of heaven, and shout. I was a free man.**

"**Therefore, if any demand is ever made on me for tobacco, tea, coffee, or strong drink of any kind that intoxicates, they must present an order from the Court above.**

"Here comes half a barrel of graham crackers, and a lot of farina, a national breadstuff of the native South Americans. I think I am now well supplied with good, nutritious food. And if there is any lack, I have some good, faithful brethren who seem to be waiting to serve me.

"I am your brother, now on retired pay in Monterey, Mich. "JOSEPH BATES. "Feb. 14, 1872."

Elder Joseph Bates died at Battle Creek, Mich., March 19, 1872, in the eightieth year of his age. His last hours, though characterized by pain such as few men have been called upon to pass through, afforded marked evidence of the superiority of faith in Christ over bodily suffering and the prospect of certain and rapidly approaching death. [258] **Having in early manhood chosen the service of God, and having for many years faithfully endeavored to live the life of the righteous, his last end was such as those alone can expect who have sedulously endeavored to preserve a conscience void of offense toward God and man.**

# Adventist Church Works to Clarify its Stance on Abortion
## Dialogue includes a diverse group of Adventist theologians, medical professionals and Church leaders

Quoting from the Committee’s Terms of Reference, Stele emphasized that the group’s third responsibility is to “prepare a draft of one unified statement that will clearly be based on **biblical principles that underline the sanctity of life and recognize the exceptionally difficult cases/anomalies** women can face.” 

“This is a deeply sensitive topic,” says Peter Landless, director of Health Ministries for the Seventh-day Adventist Church. **“My prayer is that the outcome of the deliberations will positively benefit and strengthen the work and practice of our mission in all spheres.”**

BRI director Elias Brasil de Souza agrees, saying “my hope is that **this process will help church members and the Adventist community know where the Church stands on such a critical issue. It is important to the process that the results reflect faithfulness to Scripture.”**

“As a health professional who understands how **these statements will impact the lives of real people struggling with difficult decisions**, I am encouraged by the process we are going through,” says Katia Reinert associate director of Health Ministries, and a member of both the Working Group and the Writing Committee. She concludes, “I feel confident that **we will have a statement that will provide biblical and practical insight for future guidelines, *taking into account the need for healing and wholeness of individuals and families living in a broken world.”**
