## About Christian Temperance

This website is dedicated to teaching the people about the great subject of christian temperance, expanding it over and above the common meaning that limits it to the abstenance from alcoholic drinks, bringing to view all that is comprehended by the whole subject as presented in the Holy Word of God. This, we believe, should be able to address to a large degree the ever widening, ever deeping problem of health. Paul gives us that principle which is able to stop the gormandizer in his path to self-ruin just as well as it can the drunkard. He says that `every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things.` Then Christian temperance encompasses all things.

We find few nobler men than [Jospeh Bates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bates_(Adventist)) whose life and work were an exemplification of Christian Temperance. His practice on temperance can for the most part be safely copied. We have therefore used the story of his life - how he started his journey buy quiting alcoholic drinks and grew in his practice of temperance until he was eating nothing between meals, etc, way before 1863 (before the rest of the adventists got the message of health) - to illustrate the various principles of christian temperance. We believe that his arrangement will make the reading easier for many.
